# Lab 5

Today, we will be implementing our own linear regression algorithms on a canonical dataset: *scikit-learn's* Boston housing dataset.

Lesson Plan:

1. Introduction to Jupyter Notebook
2. Introduction to Dataset
3. Work on assignment


### Comments
This is quite a difficult assignment. If you cannot finish it in class, submit it by the end of the day after the lab.
