# Lab 1 - Introduction to Python

Over the next week, we will be completing DataCamp's free online course [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science). It is a high-quality tutorial that will teach you the basis of Python and NumPy, a popular numerical python package. The whole tutorial has 4 sections, and is designed to be completed in 4 hours. A supplementary handout on if statements and for loops has also been added to this folder. Read this after you have finished Section 2.

You should finish the online Datacamp tutorial by the next lab.

You will also complete **Assignment 1** in this lab. It is a rudimentary Python exercise. When you are finished, let your TA know and he will inspect your code and note your completion.

If you are already experienced with Python, you may jump straight to the NumPy section. If you are familiar with both, you may complete the assignment to demonstrate your knowledge.
